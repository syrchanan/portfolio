Created as a foray into NLP, this project utilizes the GDELT closed captioning data of cable news channels to analyze usage patterns across networks. This iteration of the project was created to analyze coverage of the Georgia Senate runoff elections in December of 2022; however, it is built in such a way that it can be used for any event - all you need is a date and a keyword to filter around.

For further information about this project, and to see the results, please find the blog post I wrote about it [here](https://syrchanan.quarto.pub/posts/2022-ga-runoff/).
