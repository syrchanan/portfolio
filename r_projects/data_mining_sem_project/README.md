This project was twofold in aim: determine which insurance indicator has the largest effect on the policy charges, as well as finding which model best reflects our data. In the analysis, models of numerous variations were used, including: KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Neural Nets, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes. Overall, the project was a deep dive into all things machine learning, from data cleaning and preparation to executing the models and checking their accuracy.
